This repository documents an amateur exploratory programme. The goal was understanding, not publication. Mathematical rigour is maintained where possible; every claim is labelled by confidence level. The work is shared openly so that anyone searching this geometric configuration can find a starting point.

## Overview

A 3-brane lives on the S³ horizon of a two-spin Myers-Perry-AdS5 black hole. Matter, dark energy, chirality, the baryon asymmetry, and the electromagnetic coupling constant emerge from the geometry of two asymmetric spins (a₁ = 0.222 L, a₂ = 0.135 L).

## The Central Idea: D as the source of Standard Model asymmetries

The most original feature of this work is the role of the anisotropic channel **D = a₁² − a₂²** as a shared geometric source of multiple apparently unrelated phenomena:

- **Chirality** — the frame-dragging inversion at r_h = √(a₁a₂) produces a Pöschl-Teller potential that traps only left-handed fermions. No scalar field added by hand: it emerges from the pure Myers-Perry metric with a₁ ≠ a₂.
- **Baryogenesis** — D changes sign at the inversion, defining a geometric freeze-out of the baryon asymmetry at asym = 0.178 (r_bario = 0.191 L).
- **EW gauge structure** — D carries the quadrupole and the electroweak sector.
- **DE dynamics** — D contributes to the anisotropic component of the boundary stress tensor, producing w(z) that crosses −1 in the direction observed by DESI.
- **Electromagnetic coupling** — D/S = (Ω₁−Ω₂)/(Ω₁+Ω₂) at r_bario gives α(M_Z) = 1/128.1 (Δ = 0.1%). The low-energy value α = 1/137 emerges from the same geometry at second order: 3D/(R+2S) = 3D/(O(O+4)) = 1/137.5 (Δ = 0.33%), where O = (Ω₁+Ω₂)/2.

In standard cosmology and the Standard Model, these phenomena are explained by five or more separate mechanisms. Here they are projections of the same geometric asymmetry.

### The α geometry in detail

The two values of α are the only physically relevant terms of the series:

```
α(n) = (2n−1) · D / (O · (O+4)^(n−1))
```

- **n=1:** D/S = 1/128.1 → α(M_Z) [high energy, single excitation of channel D]
- **n=2:** 3D/(O(O+4)) = 1/137.5 → α(low energy) [pair creation threshold, double excitation]
- **n≥3:** 1/531, 1/2445, ... — outside any physical observable

The coefficient C = 4 in (O+4) is **universal** — algebraically exact for any spin values in the limit O₁ ≈ O₂, independent of the specific DESI attractors. The factor 3 = (2·2−1) is combinatorial, not dimensional. Both verified analytically.

**Physical meaning:** The geometry fixes the boundary conditions of the electromagnetic coupling. The running between 1/137 and 1/128 (5 orders of magnitude in Q) is described by QED. Geometry sets the endpoints; QED fills the path.

## Key numerical results

| Result | Value | Observed | Discrepancy |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ω_DM/Ω_b (from asym) | 5.62 | 5.41 | 3.8% |

## Holographic boundary results (Passo C — verified on real metric)

Computed directly on the GLPP metric with xCoba/Mathematica:

| Quantity | Value | Note |
|---|---|---|
| R(g₀) | −0.404 − 0.217/sin²θ − 0.231/cos²θ | ≠ 3/2; Python artefact confirmed |
| J_D (Noether charge) | −5.371 | Real metric [V] |
| CT2 (BK counterterms) | −7063 | Finite [V] |
| C = 4 in α series | universal | All spin values tested [V] |
| (D−2)/2 factor in Vaidya | 3/2 in D=5 | xAct symbolic [V] |

**Note:** J_D is the differential angular charge (J₁−J₂)/G₅ — a thermodynamic object, not the photon current. α = D/S is the physical result; it does not require G₅.

## Known structural limits

- **Flux profile Ṁ(t):** not derivable from first principles — requires numerical 5D Einstein-Vaidya on supercomputers.
- **SU(3) non-diagonal generators:** H₂(S³) = 0 blocks them geometrically. Requires Sasaki-Einstein Y^{p,q} manifolds (string theory).
- **Full holographic stress tensor:** boundary stress tensor partially verified (g₀, g₂ sectors). Full g₄ sector with complete de Haro-Skenderis-Solodukhin counterterms requires Cadabra/xAct.
- **G₅ in physical units:** the absolute scale of L is not derivable from within the model (nodo B.2). Ratios like D/S bypass this; absolute currents like J_D do not.
- **α running:** the geometry fixes the boundary conditions (1/128 and 1/137.5) but not the logarithmic running between them — that is standard QED.

The brane causality critique is resolved: Apostolopoulos-Tetradis 2004/2005 covers the dynamic case exactly. The brane is timelike at r_b > r_h.
